# Social Network API

# Description

I developed an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js, Mongoose, and Javascript date library. This application is not deployed, below there is a video showing the functionality of this application using Insomnia. I learned how to use the MongoDB database, I was also able to keep practicing how to create and use routes. I also was able to keep learning how to test POST, DELETE, GET, and PUT in Insomnia.
